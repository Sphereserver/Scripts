[COMMENT sphere_item_building_doors]
Doors should have a direction towards which they open.
Pre-SE doors have their item ID following the same sequence so they can get open/close ID
automatically using an simple formula. But SE+ doors doesn't follow the same sequence, so
their open/close ID must be set on scripts.
